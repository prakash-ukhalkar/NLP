## Introduction & Project Vision

Welcome to `Natural Language Processing (NLP)`!

This repository serves as a beginner-friendly, step-by-step guide to mastering Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Python programming language. My approach is uniquely focused on **Practical Learning**, **Code Implementation**, and **Concept Understanding**, providing comprehensive insights through hands-on examples and real-world datasets.

Whether you're a student, a self-learner, or someone transitioning into data science, this repo provides a clear, structured path to understanding the fundamental concepts of NLP.

### **Focus Areas**

* **NLTK & SpaCy Mastery**: Deep-dive into NLP libraries like NLTK, SpaCy, and text preprocessing techniques.
* **Text Processing**: Feature engineering, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and text vectorization.
* **Algorithm Implementation**: Step-by-step implementation of classic NLP algorithms with detailed explanations.
* **Storytelling**: Every analysis is accompanied by clear, educational markdown explanations and practical business applications.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized as a sequential learning path via Jupyter Notebooks.

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks locally, follow these steps.

### **1. Prerequisites**

* **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
* **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### **2. Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prakash-ukhalkar/NLP.git
   cd NLP
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Using venv (standard Python)
   python -m venv nlp_env
   source nlp_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: nlp_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # OR
   jupyter lab
   ```

### **3. Running the Analysis**

Start with the notebook `01_chapter_introduction` and proceed sequentially through the numbered directories.
